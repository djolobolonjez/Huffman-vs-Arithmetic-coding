# Huffman-vs-Arithmetic-coding
## Homework for the Telecommunications course - Comparison of compression ratio of Huffman and Arithmetic codes for short sequences
* Input files contain several examples of short sequences of characters and the output shows the compression ratio of both Huffman and Arithmetic code.
* You can try running it on longer sequences and check for results (input files should be inside the "input" directory). After running the code, "out" directory will be generated, with the results in it.
